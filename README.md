# Rock Paper Scissor lizard spock
 rock paper scissor is game is played by children and adults and is popular all over the world. Apart from being a game played to pass time, the game is usually played in situations where something has to be chosen. It is similar in that way to other games like flipping the coin, throwing dice or drawing straws. There is no room for cheating or for knowing what the other person is going to do so the results are usually very satisfying with no room for fighting or error.with the addition of lizard and spock it cuts down the amount of ties and make your decision to predict what your opponate will use harder.
 My game has a very simplistic look and colour scheme which make it quick and easy to use.

### Features Left to Implement
i would have like to have put all the posiible outcomes at the top and maybe make it in to a multi page game.

### Testing
I tested this page on different browsers:chrome,safari and edge.  
I confirmed that the navigation, header, current events, sign up and contact us text is all readable and easy to understand. I tested to see if all the button worked the way they suppost to at differnt window sizes.

### Bugs
the restart button is not positioned right and is stuck in the one postion even when the window size changes. It also does not appear all the time. At the moment i cant see why thats the case but in the future with a bit more time and maybe help from other i can fix it.
